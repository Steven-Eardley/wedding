                <p>People assume that time is a strict progression of cause-and-effect... but actually, from a non-linear, non-subjective viewpoint, it's more like a big ball of wibbly-wobbly... timey-wimey... stuff. What? What?! WHAT?! Allons-y! I'd call you a genius, except I'm in the room. I'm Dr. James McCrimmon from the township of Balamory. Aw, I wanted to be ginger! I've never been ginger! And you, Rose Tyler! Fat lot of good you were! You gave up on me! Ooh, that's rude. Is that the sort of man I am now? Am I rude? Rude and not ginger.</p>

                <p>There was a war. A Time War. The Last Great Time War. My people fought a race called the Daleks, for the sake of all creation. And they lost. We lost. Everyone lost. They're all gone now. My family. My friends. Even that sky. You need to get yourself a better dictionary. When you do, look up 'genocide'. You'll find a little picture of me there, and the caption'll read 'Over my dead body'. There's something else I've always wanted to say: Allons-y, Alonso! Blimey, trying to make an Ood laugh... What? What?! WHAT?!</p>
