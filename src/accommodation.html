    For guests with a little further to travel, here are a few suggestions to help with places to stay nearby.
</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>We have rooms available at our reception venue, the <a href="https://www.doubletree-queensferry.co.uk" target="_blank">Hilton Queensferry Crossing</a>,
            at a fixed rate of Â£105 per night B&B for a double room. This isn't necessarily cheaper than booking directly in advance
            or from other websites, since it was fixed a year ago. It may look better closer to the time.
            To book these, call the hotel on 01383 410000 and mention our surnames (Bowden and Eardley) and the date of the wedding (24th March).</p>

            <p>The Hilton is across the Firth of Forth from Dalmeny, where the ceremony will be.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            Nearby to the Hilton there's the <a href="http://ferrybridgehotel.net" target="_blank">Ferrybridge Hotel</a>, which is in North Queensferry.
        </li>
        <li>
            There's a <a href="https://www.premierinn.com/gb/en/hotels/scotland/lothian/edinburgh/edinburgh-south-queensferry.html" target="_blank">Premier Inn</a> in South Queensferry,
            which is nearer the location of the ceremony, but would require a drive back over the bridge in the evening.
        </li>
    </ul>
